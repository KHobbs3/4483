# Compiled Results:
# TEST
### Biplots:
mothur:
  - still small PC1 and PC2 values for mothur output
  - lots of overlap between subgroups in biplot
  - presence of uncoloured points in biplot - does this mean there are extra samples that were not subsetted?
    - yes, 105 samples that had SVs generated from 454 sequencing were removed so that only Illumina-generated SVs remained

dada2:
- samples do not show clear difference between each other. Supported by:
    - low PC value
    - large overlap of ellipses in compositional Space
    - no clear driver shown in loadings (mass is centered around origin (0,0)
    indicating symmetry in data and no presence of OTUs/features
    driving sample variation)

### Count tables:

parameter | mothur | dada2
----------|--------|-------
No. OTUs  | 10620  |
filtering method | OTUs with mean reads >= 1 are kept | count > 10 are kept
No. post-filter | 1191 | 2243
**Table 1.**  Summary and comparison of count tables generated by mothur and dada2 using the Multiple Sclerosis test dataset.



### qualprofiles:
dada2:
forward - relatively high median score (~35 represented by the green line) indicating good quality up until ~130 bases and 150 bases.
    - it is expected that quality drops off near the end of the read due to the instruments capacity and incorporation of technical sequencing error.
    - ["DADA2 incorporates quality information into its error model which makes the algorithm robust to lower quality sequence, but trimming as the average qualities crash will improve the algorithm’s sensitivity to rare sequence variants"](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html)
reverse - similar quality score but more deviation than forward reads as expected due to Illumina
  - quartiles of distribution are lower

### ALDEx2 OUTPUT:
  - MA - all
      - clustering of black (rare) SVs around zero
      -  dispersion extends to a relative abundance of 12

### MA Plots:
mothur --> DESEq2
unreadable, likely a sign of the normalization method applied which is embedded in a DESeq2 function and if the script was modified it was not reported by the researchers.

dada2 --> DESeq2
unreadable, likely a sign of the normalization method applied which is embedded in a DESeq2 function and if the script was modified it was not reported by the researchers.


mothur --> ALDEx2
Centered at zero indicates proper normalization

dada2 --> ALDEx2
Centered at zero indicates proper normalization

*** possible conclusions: ***
  - normalization of data performed by DESeq2 is the problem, the data itself could potentially be fine (as shown by ALDEx2 results)
   but the normalization tool must've been modified by researchers and not reported.

## FINDING ERRORS (TECHNICAL AND FPs):
### propR workflow
dada2 output:
  - using a rho value of 0.7 and 0.6 no mean differences in clrs were detected
  - using a rho value of 0.5 detected 6 SV pairs; however, no clr mean differences were significant (>|2|)

mothur output:
  - rho value of 0.7 generated 18 OTU pairs
  - clr differences range from +/- 0.6 to +/- 4.5, indicating presence of technical errors
      - no tax assignments of technical errors corresponded to those with claimed significant difference by published article;
      therefore, false positive assignments by articles are not due to technical sequencing error. Since data transformation was controlled for in the rho analysis of mothur output, the absence of transforming data by Jangi et al
      may have caused the misinterpretation.
      - does table have to be transformed for propr analysis? If not - can validate by performing rho analysis on non-transformed mothur output.

##### ** UPDATED WITH CORRECTED TAX FILE:**
  - rho = 0.7, clr = 5
    - no results

### filtR workflow (updated June 27, 2018)
dada2 output:
  - rho = 0.7, clr cutoff = 5
    - no results generated (rho too high)
  - rho = 0.5, clr cutoff = 5
    - no results (clr too high)
  - rho = 0.5, clr = 4
    - no results (clr too high)
  - rho = 0.5, clr = 3
    - no results (clr too high)

mothur output:
  - rho = 0.7, clr cutoff = 5
    - 4 OTU pairs removed

parameter | mothur | dada2
----------|--------|-------
No. OTUs  | 10620  |
filtering method | OTUs with mean reads >= 1 are kept | count > 10 are kept
No. post-filter | 1191 | 2243
**Table 1B.**  Summary and comparison of filtR results generated by mothur and dada2 using the Multiple Sclerosis test dataset.

  plots:
    - 3 out of 4 pairs fit well to either both the linear model + expected results line or the linear model alone
    - 1 pair has, confusingly, lots of dispersion (high residuals) and a high rho value as well as a low clr mean difference
      - the high rho value is whats driving the pair to be filtered although it is unclear what is driving the high rho values
      - possible driver is the intercept of the clr mean difference

*** possible conclusions ***
- why did dada2 generate more significant ASVs using DESeq2?
    - unreliable result due to data normalization
    - could it be because of the small sample size (small changes that are not significant appear signficant - see most recent gloor submission to nature)?

## Finding Sig Results:
### DESeq2:
  - MA plots:
    - plots look VERY different from those generated by ALDEx2...

DESeq2 | ALDEx2
-------|-------
red points at y lims, no clustering, dispersion as x -> 1e03 | points cluster around zero, disperse as x -> lim
xlim: (1e-03, 1e03)  | xlim: (0, 12)
ylim: (-1, 1)  | ylim: (-3, 3)
**Table 5.**  summary of MA plots for dada2 output using DESeq2 and ALDEx2 data analysis tools.

  - smaller range of log-fold change in DESeq2 than ALDEx2 although points still appear significant
    - larger range of means for DESeq2 results suggest greater variation within data subsets(?)

mothur:
  - cvint/cvcop: similar shape to dada2, different centre (not centered around zero) and more dense
  - cvu: different shape, high density at ylim = 1


*both dada2 and mothur have log2fold changes that range from (-1, 1)*


- Dispersion plots:

parameter | dada2 | mothur
----------|-------|-------
line of fit | horizontal linear until (1e01, 1e02) | asymptotic (horizontal asymptote at y=1e01) with a steep negative slope
outliers | many at y = 1e02 | few at y = 1e02

## POSITIVE CONTROL DATASET RESULTS:
### Dada2
  - err profiles: C2G appears error prone (deviates from trendline) but the remaining transitions/transversions appear to occur as expected
  - quality scores:
    - reads are ~ 250 bp in length
    - forward: consistent q score between 30-40
    - reverse: consistent q score between 30-40 for 150 bp then q dips to ~25 afterwards
  - pipeline results:

**Table 7.**  summary of results generated by dada2 and QIIME pipelines.


### filtR

rho CO | clr CO | dada2 result
-------|--------|-------------
0.7    | 5      | clr too high (NA)
0.7    | 4      | clr too high (NA)
0.7    | 3      | clr too high (NA)
0.7    | 2      | clr too high (NA)
0.5    | 1      | clr too high (NA)
0.3    | 1      | clr too high (NA)
**Table 8.** filtR results for a counts table generated by dada2.

rho CO | clr CO | QIIME result
    -------|--------|-------------
    0.7    | 5      | clr too high (NA)
    0.7    | 4      | clr too high (NA)
    0.7    | 3      | clr too high (NA)
    0.7    | 2      | clr too high (NA)
    0.7    | 1      | clr too high (NA)
    0.5    | 1      | clr too high (NA)
    0.3    | 1      | clr too high (NA)
**Table 9A.** filtR results for a counts table generated by QIIME.

Possible conclusions:
- Since both QIIME and dada2 count tables did not generate technical errors (according to filtR), it is possible that dada2 found more SVs than QIIME due to its higher resolution.
- The additional SVs may represent biological variation that was falsely clustered using the OTU based approach to processing reads employed by QIIME.

#### Updated filtR results (July 20, 2018)
rho CO | clr CO | QIIME result | dada2
-------|--------|--------------|------
    0.7    | 5      | 1 pair rmvd | 0
**Table 9B.** filtR results for a counts table generated by QIIME and dada2.

plot:
- linear model and expected line overlap
- large clr difference between OTUs
- low residuals but moderate rho value (0.75)

therefore, this OTU pair was correctly removed by filtR and this shows technical variants are present in QIIME output

## NEGATIVE CONTROL RESULTS:
### Using tax assignment to identify spike-ins (makes assumption that NA-labelled SVs are spike-ins):
dada2 results:

... | "Bacteria:NA:NA:NA:NA:NA" | "NA:NA..."
----|---------------------------|----------
No. of SVs| 187 | 66
**Table 10.**  Summary of sequence variants with unknown taxonomic classifications.

Total SVs for dada2 control set: 988


QIIME results:
  - for the QIIME sample set ('control_24_samples_tax') the col containing taxonomic assignments was renamed "tax.vector"
  - must identify how QIIME labels reads without tax assignment
    - all SVs have some classification...`
      - **note that QIIME tax table uses a different ref DB**

Total SVs for mothur control set: 1752

### Using sequences to identify spike-ins:
- Unsuccessful attempts to confirm that the synthetic variable regions were filtered by dada2. This hypothesis is left unconfirmed.
- Both dada2 and QIIME count tables do not include the synthetic variable regions possibly because they are filtered out due to
    - low abundances (most likely)
    - errors? (unlikely)
    - dada2 could have identified them as potential technical errors
